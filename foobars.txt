         "bio":"Gandalf the Grey (also known as Mithrandir and Olórin) is a wise wizard who was sent to Middle-Earth around year 1000 in the Third Age, more than 2000 years before the setting of The Lord of the Rings, to help the free peoples fight the evil Sauron, along with Saruman the White (who later abandoned his task) and three other wizards. Gandalf befriended many peoples and became a well-known name all over Middle-Earth. In the year 3018 Gandalf was selected to lead the Fellowship of the Ring. After defeating the evil Balrog of Moria, Gandalf the Grey died and ressurected as Gandalf the White, and continued fighting Sauron. When Sauron was defeated, Gandalf left Middle-Earth and went over the sea, where he had come from. Gandalf was of origin a Maia.Manwe sent him and four other Maia to Middle - Earth to confront the evil in Dol Guldur(which was actually caused by Sauron).The five Maia had their powers reduced and took on the form of aged men.They were to use their knowledge, not their power to fight Sauron.These five Maia, who were called the Istari, or Wizards, arrived in Middle - Earth to rid it of Sauron.However, by the start of the War of the Ring, only Gandalf was still faithfull to his quest.Saruman had in fact gone against the Istari completely. Cirdan the Shipwright recongnized Gandalf as the wisest of them, and gave to him Narya, the Elvish Ring of Fire(one of the three rings they obtained in the 2 nd Age). for Erebor, which is described in the book The Hobbit.",

         "bio":"Aragorn II was the son of Arathorn and Gilraen, and an only child. He was born on March 1st, 2931 of the Third Age, he was the thirty-ninth generation of the heirs of Isildur. Aragorn was only two years old when his father died, so his mother took him to live in Rivendell. There, he was given the name Estel to hide his true identity and heritage because Sauron was searching to see if any heir of Isildur lived. Estel often went out into the wild with Elrond's sons, Elladan and Elrohir. One day they returned, and it was said that Estel had done great things. Elrond decided that it was the time to tell him his true heritage. Elrond gave to Aragorn the tokens of his house, the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. The next day, Aragorn was walking in the woods of Rivendell when he met Arwen for the first time. He had been singing of Lúthien and thought that she had appeared to him. From that moment on he loved her. Elrond could see what was in Aragorn's heart, and told him that he would have no wife until he had proved himself worthy, and that Arwen would live the life of the Elves as long as Elrond was in Middle-earth. The next day Aragorn said farewell to Elrond, Arwen, and his mother, and went into the wild. He fought in the cause against Sauron, and made friends with Gandalf the Grey. For a while he journeyed with Gandalf and gained much wisdom from him. More and more he travelled alone, and under different names. He rode with the Rohirrim and fought for Gondor under the name of Thorongil. He ventured into the East to reveal the plots of Sauron. When he was forty-nine he stopped in Lothlórien. He didn't know at first that Arwen was there. They met, and decided that one day they would be married. When Elrond next saw him, he told him that Arwen would not wed anyone less than King of both Gondor and Arnor. Aragorn went back into the wild, and Arwen thought of him often, and started to make a standard that the heir of Elendil could use. Just before the War of the Ring he met the hobbits in Bree, where he was known as Strider. He led them to Rivendell and was made a member of the Fellowship. When Gandalf fell he was their leader. In the War of the Ring, he took the Paths of the Dead, and came in the enemy's ships to save the battle. It was on one of these ships that the standard Arwen had made was unfurled. When the war was over, and Sauron destroyed, he was crowned King, and wed Arwen in Gondor. They had children, a son called Eldarion and an unknown number of unnamed daughters. In 16 of the Fourth Age he met his friends in The Shire by the Brandywine Bridge, and he gave the Star of the Dúnedain to Samwise. On March 1st, 120 of the Fourth Age he died, with Arwen by his side. Arwen herself traveled then to Lothlórien, where, come winter, she laid herself down and died as well.",

In 2980, following the deaths of his parents Drogo and Primula Baggins, Frodo is adopted by his older cousin Bilbo and is named as his heir. On September 22nd, 3001, 'Uncle' Bilbo gave a huge party to celebrate his 111st birthday and Frodo's 33rd (marking Frodo's coming-of-age as an adult). Hobbits are much like Men, but shorter (averaging between 2 and 3 feet tall) and somewhat more long-lived (90 to 100 years). Hobbits have hairy, almost furry, feet with tough, leathery soles. They tend to prefer to lead quiet, uneventful lives. Although not well-known inside the Shire, Frodo is legendary elsewhere in Middle Earth for his task in destroying the One Ring of power, and thus destroying the evil lord Sauron in the process. Accompanied by his friend and gardner Samwise Gamgee (along with as many as eight others at several points), Frodo took the long trek from the Shire to Mount Doom in Mordor. During the course of their quest, The Fellowship of The Ring encountered many attacks from external and internal forces, most notably from Gollum, who possessed the One Ring before Bilbo Baggins picked it up and subsequently gave it to Frodo. Although Frodo survived his journey to Mordor, during the trek he was wounded by the sword of the Witch King. The wound never fully healed and left Frodo unable to settle back into his life in the Shire. Because they were both Ring bearers, Frodo and Bilbo were afforded the special honor of sailing west with the elves to the Grey Havens. There, their adventures in Middle Earth ended.",
